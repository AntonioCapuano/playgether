# Playgether
Playgether is my invention that wants to goup all basketball lovers in one family.

This web app was created for academic purposes.

Who knows how long it will be online XD!

Thanks to this project I had to deal with languages and web technologies for building Web applications:
  - markup languages (HTML, CSS, ...);
  - programming languages and client-side technologies (Javascript);
  - server-side languages and technologies (Python, as database I used mongoDB with mLab);
  - (micro)Framework Flask.
  
I used Visual Studio Code to programm.
